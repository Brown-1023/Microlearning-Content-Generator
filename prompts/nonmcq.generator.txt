{{TEXT_TO_ANALYZE}}

FOCUS AREAS (if specified):
{{FOCUS_AREAS}}

Please create {{NUM_QUESTIONS}} clinical vignettes, each containing multiple questions of different types (True/False, Yes/No, Drop Down).

For each vignette:
1. Start with "Clinical Vignette [number]: [descriptive title]"
2. Provide a detailed clinical scenario (patient presentation, history, examination findings, lab results as appropriate)
3. Include a section titled "Questions and Answers:"
4. Create 3-5 questions per vignette using a mix of:
   - True/False questions
   - Yes/No questions  
   - Drop Down questions (with clear options)

For each question provide:
- The question text
- The correct answer
- A detailed explanation

Question types should test different aspects:
- True/False: Test understanding of facts, concepts, or clinical principles
- Yes/No: Test clinical decision-making or diagnostic considerations
- Drop Down: Test selection from multiple specific options (provide the options clearly)

Ensure questions progress from basic understanding to clinical application and critical thinking.

Format each vignette clearly with appropriate structure and numbering.
