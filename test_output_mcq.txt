Question 1 - Arterial Function

A medical student is reviewing the cardiovascular system during anatomy lab. The instructor points to a blood vessel and notes that it appears thick-walled, elastic, and is carrying blood away from the heart. Which of the following best describes this vessel's primary function?

A) Returns deoxygenated blood to the heart
B) Facilitates gas exchange with tissues
C) Transports oxygenated blood under high pressure
D) Stores blood volume during rest

Correct Answer: C

Explanation of the Correct Answer:
The vessel described in the scenario is an artery. The key characteristics mentioned (thick-walled, elastic, carrying blood away from the heart) are classic features of arteries. Their primary function is to transport oxygenated blood under high pressure from the heart to the body's tissues.

Analysis of Other Options:
A) Incorrect: This is the function of veins, not arteries. Veins have thinner walls and valves to prevent backflow. This is a common misconception when students confuse vessel types.
B) Incorrect: This is the primary function of capillaries. Capillaries have thin walls for easy diffusion. While important, this is not the main function of thick-walled arteries.
D) Incorrect: This is a function of veins (venous reservoirs). Veins can hold extra blood volume due to their compliance. Arteries maintain constant tone and don't typically serve as storage vessels.

Key Insights:
Arteries are distinguished by thick walls and elastic properties. The primary function of arteries is to transport oxygenated blood under pressure. Different types of blood vessels have distinct structural features that match their functions. Understanding vessel characteristics helps identify their role in the cardiovascular system.
