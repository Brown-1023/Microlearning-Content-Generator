INTRODUCTION
The term VITT (vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia) was introduced during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to refer to a rare autoimmune thrombosis syndrome caused by adenoviral-vectored COVID-19 vaccines. This syndrome, similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) but without heparin exposure, was subsequently understood to be caused by autoantibodies generated in response to adenoviral antigens.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
VITT and VITT-like disorders are caused by antibodies that recognize platelet factor 4 (PF4, also called CXCL4). The antibodies form multimolecular complexes on platelet surfaces containing PF4 and immunoglobulin G (IgG). These complexes activate platelets via low affinity platelet FcÎ³IIa receptors. Ultimately, platelet activation markedly stimulates the coagulation system and causes clinically significant thromboembolic complications.

CLINICAL FEATURES
For VITT from a COVID-19 vaccination, the window between vaccination and development of symptoms was approximately 5 to 10 days in most cases. The typical platelet count range of patients with definite VITT was 10,000 to 100,000/microL. Median platelet counts were generally <50,000/microL. 

Thrombosis was the presenting feature in most initial cases, with both venous and arterial thromboses described, often at multiple sites and in unusual locations including:
- Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT)
- Splanchnic vein thrombosis
- Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
- Arterial thrombosis including stroke

DIAGNOSIS
Laboratory testing for VITT includes:
- Complete blood count showing thrombocytopenia
- Elevated D-dimer (often greatly elevated, >10 mg/L)
- Decreased fibrinogen in approximately one-third to 50 percent of cases
- PF4 antibody testing using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
- Functional assays such as serotonin release assay (SRA)

Important: Rapid HIT assays are generally negative in VITT and should not be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis due to poor sensitivity.

MANAGEMENT
Treatment of VITT includes:
1. Anticoagulation - All patients should receive therapeutic-dose anticoagulation unless contraindicated
2. IVIG (Intravenous Immune Globulin) - 1 g/kg daily for two days to interrupt antibody-induced platelet activation
3. Avoid platelet transfusions except for critical bleeding
4. Consider plasma exchange for refractory disease

The choice of anticoagulant includes direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), fondaparinux, or direct thrombin inhibitors. Heparin can be used if HIT has been definitively excluded.
