# Project Cleanup Summary

## ✅ What Was Kept (As Required)

### Core Application Files
- **backend/** - All Python backend files with LangGraph
- **frontend/** - All Next.js/React frontend files
- **prompts/** - Plain text prompt templates
- **tests/** - Unit tests for validators
- **docs/** - Original requirement documents

### Cloud Run Deployment Files
- **Dockerfile** - Single container for both UI and API (as required in Milestone 2)
- **cloudbuild.yaml** - Google Cloud Build configuration
- **docker-compose.yml** - Local testing with Docker
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Cloud Run deployment guide
- **env.example** - Environment template

### Setup Scripts
- **setup.sh** / **setup.bat** - Simple setup scripts

## ❌ What Was Removed (Unnecessary)

### Platform-Specific Files
- Railway configuration files
- Heroku Procfile
- Vercel configuration
- Netlify settings
- Render configurations

### Redundant Files
- Multiple Dockerfile variants
- Service starter scripts (start_services.py)
- Alternative configurations
- Platform-specific deployment scripts
- Extra documentation files

### Why Removed
Per requirements (Milestone 2):
> "Serve UI and API from the **same Cloud Run service (one container)**"

No need for:
- Separate deployment configurations
- Multiple platform support files
- Complex orchestration scripts

## 📁 Final Structure

```
project/
├── backend/          # FastAPI + LangGraph backend
├── frontend/         # Next.js frontend
├── Dockerfile        # Single container (UI + API)
├── cloudbuild.yaml   # Cloud Run deployment
├── docker-compose.yml # Local development
└── README.md         # Main documentation
```

## 🚀 Deployment

Single command deployment to Cloud Run:
```bash
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml
```

The project now follows the exact requirements:
- ✅ Single container serving both UI and API
- ✅ Ready for Google Cloud Run deployment
- ✅ Clean, focused structure
- ✅ No unnecessary platform files
