# Test 1: Original problematic MCQ with multi-paragraph sections
test_mcq_1 = """Question 1--VITT diagnosis post-vaccine, next step
A 42-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe headache, nausea, and blurred vision that began 7 days after receiving her first dose of an adenoviral-vectored COVID-19 vaccine. She has no prior history of thrombotic events and takes no medications. Physical examination reveals papilledema on fundoscopic examination. Laboratory studies show: platelet count 45,000/microL (normal 150,000-400,000/microL), hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL, white blood cell count 8,500/microL, D-dimer 15.2 mg/L (normal <0.5 mg/L), fibrinogen 185 mg/dL (normal 200-400 mg/dL), and normal PT/INR and aPTT. MRI with venography confirms cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A rapid HIT immunoassay (lateral flow assay) is negative. The patient has never received heparin products.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in establishing the diagnosis?

A) Repeat rapid HIT assay in 48 hours
B) Order PF4 antibody ELISA testing
C) Proceed with lupus anticoagulant panel
D) Obtain factor V Leiden mutation testing
E) Perform bone marrow biopsy immediately

Correct Answer: B

Explanation of the Correct Answer:

B) Order PF4 antibody ELISA testing is the most appropriate next step. This patient presents with a classic constellation of findings for vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). The window between vaccination and development of symptoms was approximately 5 to 10 days in most cases, which precisely matches this patient's 7-day timeline. Her platelet count of 45,000/microL falls within the typical platelet count range of patients with definite VITT of 10,000 to 100,000/microL; median platelet counts were generally <50,000/microL. The markedly elevated D-dimer of 15.2 mg/L often greatly exceeds 10 mg/L, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis represents one of the characteristic unusual thrombosis sites. PF4 antibody testing using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is part of the diagnostic laboratory testing for VITT. Most critically, rapid HIT assays are generally negative in VITT and should not be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis due to poor sensitivity, making PF4 ELISA the definitive next diagnostic step. VITT and VITT-like disorders are caused by antibodies that recognize platelet factor 4 (PF4), establishing PF4 antibody detection as the cornerstone of diagnosis.

Analysis of Other Options (Distractors):

A) Repeat rapid HIT assay in 48 hours is not the best choice because rapid HIT assays are generally negative in VITT and should not be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis due to poor sensitivity. Repeating a test with poor sensitivity for this condition would delay appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The negative rapid HIT assay in this clinical context is expected and does not rule out VITT.

C) Proceed with lupus anticoagulant panel is not the best choice because while antiphospholipid syndrome can cause thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, the temporal relationship to vaccination (7 days post-adenoviral vaccine), the specific thrombosis location (CVT), and the extremely elevated D-dimer are classic for VITT rather than antiphospholipid syndrome. Testing for lupus anticoagulant would not address the most likely diagnosis given the clinical presentation and would delay appropriate VITT-specific management.

D) Obtain factor V Leiden mutation testing is not the best choice because inherited thrombophilias like factor V Leiden do not cause acute thrombocytopenia or the dramatically elevated D-dimer levels seen in this patient. The temporal association with vaccination and the acute presentation with thrombocytopenia make an inherited thrombophilia an unlikely primary explanation. This testing would be more appropriate for evaluation of unprovoked thrombosis without the acute features present here.

E) Perform bone marrow biopsy immediately is not the best choice because bone marrow biopsy is not indicated in the acute diagnostic evaluation of suspected VITT. The thrombocytopenia in VITT is immune-mediated (caused by antibody-induced platelet activation and consumption), not due to bone marrow failure or infiltration. The pathophysiology involves antibodies forming multimolecular complexes on platelet surfaces that activate platelets via low affinity platelet FcÎ³IIa receptors, indicating a peripheral consumptive process rather than a production problem requiring bone marrow evaluation.

Key Insights: VITT should be strongly suspected when thrombocytopenia (platelet count 10,000-100,000/microL), unusual site thrombosis (especially CVT), and markedly elevated D-dimer (>10 mg/L) occur 5-10 days after adenoviral-vectored COVID-19 vaccination. Rapid HIT immunoassays have poor sensitivity for VITT and are generally negative; they should not be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis. PF4 antibody ELISA testing is the appropriate diagnostic modality. Prompt recognition and confirmation of VITT through PF4 antibody testing is critical because management includes specific interventions (therapeutic anticoagulation, IVIG, avoidance of platelet transfusions except for critical bleeding) that differ from standard thrombocytopenia or thrombosis management."""
