<Question 15

A 60-year-old man has a low-grade, 1.5 cm acinic cell carcinoma of the parotid gland completely excised via a superficial parotidectomy with negative margins. He has no perineural invasion, no nodal involvement, and no other high-risk features. Imaging confirms no residual disease. In the absence of unfavorable prognostic factors, what is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Postoperative radiation therapy

B. Chemoradiation therapy

C. Observation and routine follow-up

D. Elective neck dissection

Correct Answer: C>

<Explanation of the Correct Answer:

C) Observation and routine follow-up is the most appropriate next step. The text explicitly states, "Adjuvant radiation is not recommended for patients with lower-risk tumors. Benign salivary gland tumors and early-stage, low-grade malignancies including low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas, acinic cell carcinomas, and low-grade adenocarcinomas are well controlled with complete surgical resection, with control rates reaching 85 percent at 10 years." This patient has a low-grade acinic cell carcinoma that was completely excised with negative margins and no other high-risk features. The text further notes, "If margins are negative, adjuvant RT is generally not indicated." Therefore, in the absence of any unfavorable prognostic factors, observation with routine follow-up is the standard of care for such low-risk tumors.

Analysis of Other Options (”Distractors”)

A) Postoperative radiation therapy is not indicated for low-grade acinic cell carcinoma with negative margins and no other high-risk features. The text specifically advises against adjuvant RT for such low-risk tumors.

B) Chemoradiation therapy is not the standard of care for this early-stage, low-grade malignancy. Chemotherapy is primarily reserved for metastatic disease or being investigated in clinical trials for high-risk locoregional disease.

D) Elective neck dissection is not necessary as the tumor is low-grade, small, and there is no evidence of nodal involvement or other high-risk features suggesting occult nodal metastasis. The text recommends elective neck dissection for high-grade tumors or advanced-stage disease.>

<summary>

Low-grade salivary gland carcinomas, such as acinic cell carcinoma, that are completely excised with negative margins and without high-risk features do not typically require adjuvant radiation therapy. Observation and routine follow-up are appropriate in such low-risk cases.

**Question 10**
A 77-year-old woman with chronic systolic heart failure (NYHA Class III) and a history of multiple hospitalizations is followed in a cardiology clinic. She complains of profound fatigue and dyspnea on minimal exertion. Her hemoglobin is 10.2 g/dL, and her iron studies show a ferritin of 150 mcg/L and a TSAT of 16%. Her renal function is normal. The cardiologist initiates intravenous iron supplementation. In addition to correcting potential absolute iron deficiency, what is a key anti-inflammatory mechanism by which a therapy that improves iron availability to the marrow, such as an ESA, could benefit this patient?
Correct Answer: C
Explanation of the Correct Answer:
This question explores the secondary or feedback effects of treatments for anemia. The patient has ACD/AI secondary to chronic heart failure. The text describes a potential beneficial feedback loop involving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Under the section "Reduced erythropoietin," it states: "Administration of EPO or other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may have an antiinflammatory effect and reduce hepcidin expression." This suggests that by stimulating erythropoiesis, ESAs can create a strong demand for iron that overrides the inflammatory signals, leading to a reduction in hepcidin. This, in turn, would improve iron trafficking from macrophages to erythroid precursors, further ameliorating the anemia. This anti-inflammatory, hepcidin-lowering effect is a key mechanism of action beyond simply stimulating the bone marrow.
Analysis of Other Options (“Distractors”):
	• A) It directly inhibits TNF-alpha production by macrophages: The text does not describe a mechanism by which ESAs or iron directly inhibit TNF-alpha production. The anti-inflammatory effect is mediated through the hepcidin axis.
	• B) It increases the expression of the ferroportin channel: Therapies like ESAs do not directly increase ferroportin expression. Instead, by lowering hepcidin, they prevent the internalization and degradation of existing ferroportin channels, thus restoring their function.
	• D) It enhances the biologic activity of endogenous vitamin D: The text mentions that vitamin D may suppress hepcidin, but it does not suggest that ESAs or iron therapy have any effect on vitamin D metabolism or activity.
	• E) It promotes the clearance of circulating inflammatory cytokines: The text does not support the idea that ESAs or iron therapy act as a scavenger or clearance mechanism for cytokines like IL-6 or TNF-alpha. The effect is on the downstream mediator, hepcidin.
<summary>
Therapies that stimulate erythropoiesis, such as ESAs, can have beneficial secondary effects in anemia of inflammation. Beyond their primary function, they can exert an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing hepcidin expression. This creates a positive feedback loop, improving iron availability and further enhancing the response to treatment.

Correct Answer: C
Explanation of the Correct Answer:
C) It reduces hepcidin expression and improves iron trafficking. This question explores the secondary or feedback effects of treatments for anemia. The patient has anemia of chronic disease/inflammation (ACD/AI) secondary to chronic heart failure. A potential beneficial feedback loop involving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) exists. Administration of EPO or other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may have an anti-inflammatory effect and reduce hepcidin expression. This suggests that by stimulating erythropoiesis, ESAs can create a strong demand for iron that overrides the inflammatory signals, leading to a reduction in hepcidin. This, in turn, would improve iron trafficking from macrophages to erythroid precursors, further ameliorating the anemia. This anti-inflammatory, hepcidin-lowering effect is a key mechanism of action beyond simply stimulating the bone marrow.
Analysis of Other Options (Distractors):
A) It directly inhibits TNF-alpha production by macrophages is not the best choice because there is no described mechanism by which ESAs or iron directly inhibit TNF-alpha production. The anti-inflammatory effect is mediated through the hepcidin axis.
B) It increases the expression of the ferroportin channel is not the best choice because therapies like ESAs do not directly increase ferroportin expression. Instead, by lowering hepcidin, they prevent the internalization and degradation of existing ferroportin channels, thus restoring their function.
D) It enhances the biologic activity of endogenous vitamin D is not the best choice because while vitamin D may suppress hepcidin, there is no suggestion that ESAs or iron therapy have any effect on vitamin D metabolism or activity.
E) It promotes the clearance of circulating inflammatory cytokines is not true because there is no support for the idea that ESAs or iron therapy act as a scavenger or clearance mechanism for cytokines like IL-6 or TNF-alpha. The effect is on the downstream mediator, hepcidin.
Key Insights: Therapies that stimulate erythropoiesis, such as ESAs, can have beneficial secondary effects in anemia of inflammation. Beyond their primary function, they can exert an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing hepcidin expression. This creates a positive feedback loop, improving iron availability and further enhancing the response to treatment.
