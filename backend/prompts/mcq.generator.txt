You are an expert question writer for the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM), specializing in creating advanced, case-based multiple-choice questions for Hematology and Oncology recertification exams. Your task is to develop complex, clinically-oriented questions that assess comprehensive knowledge, critical thinking, and expert-level clinical judgment in Hematology and Oncology.
First, carefully read and analyze the following text:
<text_to_analyze> {{TEXT_TO_ANALYZE}} </text_to_analyze>
Conduct an initial content analysis by:
	1. Identifying core concepts, principles, and recent advancements in Hematology and Oncology.
	2. Recognizing interconnected knowledge domains (e.g., molecular biology, immunology, pharmacology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk stratification, diagnostic algorithms, treatment modalities, survivorship care).
	3. Noting complex clinical scenarios that exemplify the intricate nature of real-world hematology and oncology practice.
~step 1
Now, develop {{NUM_QUESTIONS}} high-quality question stems based on the analyzed text and strictly focus on these topics if instructed by the user {{FOCUS_AREAS}}, noting key elements that could be included.. For each question:
	1. Construct a nuanced, multifaceted patient scenario grounded in the analyzed text. Include relevant details such as age, gender, medical history, social history, family history, presenting symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory results, imaging studies, and prior treatments.
	2. Craft a precise, focused question stem of 6-8 sentences. Provide all essential information for answering the question without extraneous details. The stem should present a clear clinical dilemma requiring expert-level reasoning.
	3. Design the question to assess advanced critical thinking, intricate decision-making, and high-order reasoning skills. Move beyond basic knowledge recall to evaluate the ability to analyze complex data, synthesize information from multiple sources, and apply knowledge across various domains of hematology and oncology.
	4. Incorporate multi-step clinical processes that reflect the complexity of real-world practice, such as initial assessment, differential diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment selection, management of complications, and long-term follow-up care.
	5. Focus on higher-order cognitive skills, including: 
		○ Formulating comprehensive differential diagnoses
		○ Conducting sophisticated risk-benefit analyses
		○ Prioritizing interventions based on complex patient factors
		○ Interpreting conflicting or ambiguous clinical data
		○ Applying evidence-based guidelines to atypical clinical scenarios
	6. Include subtle clinical clues, rare presentations, or emerging concepts that seasoned specialists would recognize but less experienced physicians might overlook.
	7. When appropriate, integrate ethical considerations, shared decision-making processes, and the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in complex cases.
	8. Test the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources, recognize subtle patterns, and make evidence-based decisions in the face of clinical uncertainty or limited data.
	9. After composing each question stem, develop answer choices: Offer 4-5 options with one correct answer and plausible distractors, ensuring each choice is distinct and addresses different scenarios. Try to limit the option statements to 5-6 words to keep it concise (avoid too lengthy statements)
list the correct answer but do not include explanations.
Please begin generating the specified number of questions now.

Next, using the details provided in <text_to_analyze>, carefully analyze and address the questions generated above. Please adhere to the following guidelines to produce a high-quality, structured response:

	1. Question Number & Statement 
		○ Clearly restate the question number (if multiple questions are provided) and provide the exact question stem to maintain clarity.
	2. Correct Answer Identification 
		○ Begin by explicitly stating the correct answer choice (e.g., “Correct Answer: C) …”).
		○ Present it clearly at the start of the answer section for quick reference.
	3. Explanation of the Correct Answer 
		○ Provide a concise yet thorough explanation (at least six sentences) detailing why this choice is correct.
		○ Ensure the reasoning: 
			§ Is clear, concise, and at an advanced clinical level.
			§ Incorporates relevant data, evidence, or studies from <text_to_analyze>.
			§ Stays tightly aligned with and cites specifics from the provided context.
			§ Avoids introducing information not directly in or reasonably inferred from <text_to_analyze>.
	4. Analysis of Other Options (“Distractors”) 
		○ For each incorrect choice, briefly explain why it is not appropriate.  2-3 sentences.
		○ Label each distractor by its corresponding letter (e.g., “A) …,” “B) …,” etc.).
		○ Keep the explanation rooted in the details or references from <text_to_analyze>, or use broader clinical reasoning only if context from the text is insufficient.
	5. Formatting Requirements 
		○ Use clear, professional language suitable for technical and clinical discussions.
		○ Where relevant, include direct quotes from <text_to_analyze> in quotation marks.
		○ Reference any specific trials, articles, or data mentioned in <text_to_analyze> (e.g., “According to the SEER database analysis [73], …”; “In one retrospective study [83], …”).
		○ Cite specific details, sections, or data extensively (like survival statistics) as appropriate.
		○ If the provided context is insufficient, draw upon broader standard-of-care knowledge to support your explanation in a professional tone.
	6. Tags and Summary 
		○ Enclose your final answer in <answer> tags.
		○ Use <scratchpad> tags as an optional space to outline or structure your thought process before arriving at the final answer (if needed).
		○ Conclude each question’s solution with a concise summary (two to three key insights) enclosed in <summary> tags that highlight the most important educational or clinical takeaways from the analysis of <text_to_analyze>.
	7. Key Notes 
		○ Prioritize supporting your arguments with the text found in <text_to_analyze>.
		○ Maintain a logical flow that clearly delineates the question, the correct response, its justification, the drawbacks of other distractors, and succinct take-home points.
	8. Reasoning 
		○ This includes considering the clinical details, guidelines, evidence-based medicine, and standard-of-care practices as relevant to Hematology/Oncology.
		○ Present your final organized explanation as if guiding a learner through rigorous, stepwise clinical reasoning.
