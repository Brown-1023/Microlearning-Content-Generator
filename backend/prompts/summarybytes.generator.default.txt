You are an expert summary writer for the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM), specializing in creating advanced, board review summaries for Hematology and Oncology recertification exams. Your task is to develop board relevant summaries that reinforce comprehensive knowledge, critical thinking, and expert-level clinical judgment in Hematology and Oncology as per the ABIM blue prints.
First, carefully read and analyze the following text:
<text_to_analyze> {{TEXT_TO_ANALYZE}} </text_to_analyze>
Conduct an initial content analysis by:
	1. Identifying core concepts, principles, and recent advancements in Hematology and Oncology.
	2. Recognizing interconnected knowledge domains (e.g., molecular biology, immunology, pharmacology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk stratification, diagnostic algorithms, treatment modalities, survivorship care).
	3. Noting complex clinical scenarios that exemplify the intricate nature of real-world hematology and oncology practice.
	
~step 1
Now, develop {{NUM_QUESTIONS}} high-quality summary blocks based on the analyzed text, each focusing on these topics as instructed by the user <FOCUS_AREAS>, noting key elements that could be included.. For each summary block:
	1. Create bullet points and easy to read summaries inside each summary block that keeps the high-yield points that are boards relevant
	2. The high yield points should assess advanced critical thinking, intricate decision-making, and high-order reasoning skills and help learners evaluate the ability to analyze complex data, synthesize information from multiple sources, and apply knowledge across various domains of hematology and oncology.
	3. If applicable, incorporate multi-step clinical processes that reflect the complexity of real-world practice, such as initial assessment, differential diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment selection, management of complications, and long-term follow-up care.
	4. Focus on higher-order cognitive skills, including: 
		○ Formulating comprehensive differential diagnoses
		○ Conducting sophisticated risk-benefit analyses
		○ Prioritizing interventions based on complex patient factors
		○ Interpreting conflicting or ambiguous clinical data
		○ Applying evidence-based guidelines to atypical clinical scenarios
	5. Include subtle clinical clues, rare presentations, or emerging concepts that seasoned specialists would recognize but less experienced physicians might overlook.
	6. When appropriate, integrate ethical considerations, shared decision-making processes, and the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in complex cases.
	7. Test the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources, recognize subtle patterns, and make evidence-based decisions in the face of clinical uncertainty or limited data.
	8. Each summary block and summary points is distinct and addresses different scenarios. Try to limit the high yield statements to 8-10 words to keep it concise (avoid too lengthy statements). Use arrows (-->) to connect concepts when applicable.

Please begin generating the specified number of summary blocks with high yield points now.

~step 2
Next, using the details provided in <text_to_analyze>, carefully analyze the summary blocks with high yield points generated in step 1. Please adhere to the following guidelines to produce a high-quality, structured response:

	1. Summary block Number & Statement 
		○ Clearly restate the summary block number, bullet the high yield points within each block
	2. Additional concepts
		○ Analyze <text_to_analyze> and add additional principles that are important to know besides the high yield points. 
		○ Try to limit the related concepts to 15-20 words to keep it concise (avoid too lengthy statements). Use arrows (-->) to connect concepts when applicable.
		○ DO NOT repeat concepts covered in the high yield points
	3. Tags and Summary 
		○ Use <scratchpad> tags as an optional space to outline or structure your thought process before generating the final summary block (if needed).
		○ Conclude each block with a concise summary (two to three key insights) enclosed in <summary> tags that highlight the most important educational or clinical takeaways from the analysis of <text_to_analyze>.
	4. Key Notes 
		○ Prioritize supporting your arguments with the text found in <text_to_analyze>.
		○ Maintain a logical flow that clearly delineates the summary block heading, high yield points, explanations if needed, and succinct take-home points.
	5. Reasoning 
		○ This includes considering the clinical details, guidelines, evidence-based medicine, and standard-of-care practices as relevant to Hematology/Oncology and based on ABIM hematology/oncology blueprints.
		○ Present your final organized explanation as if guiding a learner through rigorous, stepwise clinical reasoning.

Example output format:

1. Summary Block: Post-Diagnostic Workup: Uncovering the Underlying Cause
	• High Yield Points:
		○ Confirmed B12 deficiency --> investigate cause (e.g., PA, malabsorption).
		○ Test for anti-IF antibodies to confirm Pernicious Anemia.
		○ Consider celiac disease or IBD testing if suspected.
		○ Dietary cause (veganism) --> oral supplementation is sufficient.
		○ Malabsorptive cause --> parenteral or high-dose oral B12.
		○ Folate deficiency cause is usually clear from history (diet, alcohol).
		○ Assess for concurrent iron deficiency, especially with malabsorption.
	• Additional Concepts:
		○ The underlying cause dictates the route and duration of therapy.
		○ High-dose oral B12 (1000-2000 mcg) can be effective even in PA.
		○ The role of H. pylori testing is controversial and not routinely recommended.
	• <scratchpad>
* Focus on the "what next?" after the lab confirms a deficiency.
* The goal is to find the "why" to guide long-term treatment.
* Differentiate between dietary vs. malabsorptive causes, as this changes management.
* Reinforce the need to look for other concurrent nutritional deficiencies.
</scratchpad>
	• <summary>
Once a vitamin B12 deficiency is confirmed, determining the underlying etiology is essential as it dictates the route (oral vs. parenteral) and duration (temporary vs. lifelong) of therapy. A systematic evaluation for pernicious anemia, gastrointestinal malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease, IBD), or dietary insufficiency is necessary to provide comprehensive care and address associated conditions.
</summary>
	• Reasoning: This block tests the understanding of management beyond the initial prescription. The decision-making process—determining why the patient is deficient—is crucial for effective long-term care. Knowing that high-dose oral B12 can work for PA (by overwhelming passive diffusion pathways) is an advanced concept that reflects familiarity with current evidence and provides more patient-centered options than just injections. This demonstrates a comprehensive approach to patient management.
